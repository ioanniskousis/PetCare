# PetCare - a pet lovers' application

### The project aims for pet owners to track their treatment. Pet owners have to login to the application and insert information about any number of pets they own. They can record any event of their petsâ€™ lives like vaccinations, illnesses, nutrition, grooming, weight control, everyday hobbies etc. . Also, users can schedule appointments with a vet or a groomer.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About the project

This project is using the *devise* gem to handle users' authentication. A user's entry requires the following fields : email, password, first name and surname.  
The logged in user has full access on their content and only view access to the content of the rest of the users.  
The user can insert any number of pets and add treatment records related to a particular pet.  
A pet requires a *name* field and optionally can have : *date of birth*, species*, *race*, *breed*, *color*, *gender*, *sterilised status*, *notes* about the pet and an unlimited number of photos or videos.  
A treatment record holds information about a case of an incident of treatment such as the *date & time*, an *item* which denotes what kind of treatment the pet takes e.g. Vaccination, Hair Cut, or Surgery Operation, a *description*, a *location* to denote the clinic or anywhere else, and the *cost* of the incident. Additionally, a case can have an unlimited number of photos or videos.  
Additionally, the user can keep track of appointments related to their pets treatment noting the date & time, a title, some content, the location and the done status.
